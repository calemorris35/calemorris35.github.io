    <h2>Tangerine</h2>
    <p>Toshi Omagari is the principal designer who created Tangerine. Tangerine is a calligraphic typeface that grew inspiration revolving around the 16th and 17th century style of chancery cursive. The most distinct characteristic for the font is its tall ascender that takes a wide line space between lines resulting in a graceful texture (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tangerine?selection.family=Tangerine">Tangerine</a>). Toshi named the font after a women who encouraged him to begin his work. The elegant curves and structure of the Tangerine while creating a soft message is the reason I chose this font.</p>
